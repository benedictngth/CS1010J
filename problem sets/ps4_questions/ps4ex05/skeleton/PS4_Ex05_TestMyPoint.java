 * CS1010J Programming Methodology
 * Problem Set 4 Exercise #05: PS4_Ex05_TestMyPoint.java
 * 
 * This class demonstrates the use of MyPoint class.
 * It reads a double seed and generates 2 points p and q as follows:
 *   p's x-coordinate: divide seed by 17 and take the quotient
 *   p's y-coordinate: divide seed by 53 and take the remainder
 *   q's x-coordinate: divide seed by 11 and take the quotient
 *   q's y-coordinate: divide seed by 41 and take the remainder
 * It then computes, by invoking appropriate member methods of the MyPoint class,
 * the Euclidean distance between the two points, and the area of the
 * rectangle bounded by these 2 points as the opposite corners.
