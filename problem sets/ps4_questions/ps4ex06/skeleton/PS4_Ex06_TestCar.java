 * CS1010J Programming Methodology
 * Problem Set 4 Exercise #06: PS4_Ex06_Car.java
 * 
 * This program uses Car class. It reads in a car's information,
 * and creates a Car object. It then reads a list of trips, updates
 * the odometer reading, and computes the average distance travelled per trip.
