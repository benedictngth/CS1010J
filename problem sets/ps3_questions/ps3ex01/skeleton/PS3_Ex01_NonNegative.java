    /* We have seen the word 'stub' many times. What is a 'stub'?
     * 
     * A stub is a method which is incomplete, but has enough code to
     * be compiled and work with other methods. When programmers are writing
     * code together, they frequently use stubs as placeholders until
     * the programmer responsible has finished the work.
     * Even if you are working alone, you may use stubs for certain parts
     * of your code while you are focusing on other parts first. This is the
     * idea of incremental development. 
     * 
     * In a stub, the body of the method usually contains only a comment
     * like 'this is a stub'. If the method needs to return a value in order
     * to compile successfully, the programmer will add a line to return
     * a dummy value, such as zero.
